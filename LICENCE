### Conclusion
This completes the world time app project! You now have a fully structured repository with:
- A functional frontend and backend
- Dockerized services
- Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure
- Ansible configuration
- Jenkins and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines with IaC integration
- Security scanning with Gitleaks, Trivy, and SonarQube
- Comprehensive documentation and top-level files

To finalize:
1. Replace placeholders (e.g., GitHub URL, Docker registry, your name in `LICENSE`).
2. Test the full pipeline locally or in your CI/CD environment.
3. Push to your GitHub repo to trigger the workflow.
